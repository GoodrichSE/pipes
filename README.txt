Trying to create the barest of bare-bones CV pipelines using nVidia's SDK. 

I'll start by manually re-creating one of the sample codes they've got. Then I'll start tweaking that.

Path to implement:
1. Learn make, cmake, and refresh on c++/g++ by making a boilerplate program that can accept CLI commands.
2. Get a program that can open a camera feed through CLI.
3. Apply a simple OpenCV process to the image.
4. Mimic the jetson-inference sample code.
5. Alter it to find center of located object, record detected objects and their relative frequency.
6. Use what I've learned to make a super simple pipeline that's not based on existing examples.
